# NGINX is configured with a client_max_body_size of 1GB to control the maximum upload size.
# If you need a different limit, edit the value in ./nginx/conf.d/client_max_body_size.conf and restart NGINX.
# Note: The current PALMR release enforces a hard 1GiB upload limit. Uploads larger than 1GiB will fail.
#       Watch for future PALMR releases that introduce the MAX_FILESIZE environment variable for configurable limits.
